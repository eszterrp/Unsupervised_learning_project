# Extended Project #3: Unsupervised Learning
## Patient Clustering
Repository is made for my Computational Machine Learning course at the Barcelona School of Economics Data Science for Decision Making program. 

Data: the MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) is a large, single-center database comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. Data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, observations and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, procedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length of stay, survival data, and more. https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/
